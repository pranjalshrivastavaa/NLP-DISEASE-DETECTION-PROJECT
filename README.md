🧠 Disease Detection using BioBERT
This project fine-tunes the BioBERT model for disease detection from natural language symptom descriptions using a custom medical Q&A dataset.

📊 Dataset
The dataset (medDataset_processed.csv) contains over 16,000 question-answer pairs from medical literature, categorized into:




Symptoms
Susceptibility
Diagnosis
Treatment
Other categories
Each entry includes:



qtype: Type of medical question
Question: Natural language medical question
Answer: Expert medical answer



🧪 Model
We use BioBERT (a domain-specific BERT model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora) and fine-tune it for a classification task using the Hugging Face transformers library.

🛠️ Installation
